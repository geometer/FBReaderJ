How to Build for Android
------------------------

Prerequisites:

1. Android SDK >= 1.6

2. Android NDK >= r4b

3. Apache Ant >= 1.7.0

4. (Windows-only) Cygwin >= 1.7

To build:

1. Create 'local.properties' file containing sdk.dir && ndk.dir definitions:
	sdk.dir=<path to the Android SDK folder>
	ndk.dir=<path to the Android NDK folder>
E.g., on my computer 'local.properties' consists of 2 lines:
  sdk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-sdk-mac_86
  ndk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-ndk-r4b

2. Tune the setup before compiling:
  2a. by copying your 'local.properties' to those third-party code directories:
      cp local.properties third-party/android-filechooser/code/
      cp local.properties third-party/drag-sort-listview/library/
      cp local.properties third-party/AmbilWarna/
  2b. by copying the Android support v4 lib:
      cp libs/android-support-v4.jar third-party/drag-sort-listview/library/libs/

3. If you use Linux or MacOS, just run 'ant dist' and go to step 3. For debugging
purposes, you might want to run 'ant debug' for building the package in debug mode, signing
with your debug key (in this case, you can skip step 3).

If you are Windows user
  3a. Run ndk-build (a program from Android NDK directory) in your project catalog;
      This program only runs from Cygwin >= 1.7, please read NDK docs for details.
      Read and try config cygwin using 'cygwin_installation_and_configuration.pdf'
  3b. Run 'ant release'.

4. Sign your package manually.
