All the files *.pattern were produced from the original TeX files. All changes
are the notation changes:
	* we use XML notation (file format is obvious form any sample)
	* '.' in patterns is replaced by ' '
	* all accented characters were written as &xxx; entities, instead of TeX
notation
  * all exceptions (\hyphenation{xxx-xx-xx} in TeX notation) were replaced
with the patterns with weights 7 and 8

Czech hyphenation pattern is excluded for the closed-source version of FBReader,
because the original TeX file is licensed under the GNU GPL.
