Overview
--------

This is the README file for liblinebreak, an implementation of the line
breaking algorithm as described in Unicode 5.2.0 Standard Annex 14,
Revision 24, available at
         <URL:http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-24.html>

Licence
-------

This library is released under an open-source licence, the zlib/libpng
licence.  Please check the file LICENCE for details.

Apart from using the algorithm, part of the code is derived from the
data provided under
                  <URL:http://www.unicode.org/Public/>

And the Unicode Terms of Use may apply:
              <URL:http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html>


Installation
------------

There are three ways to build the library:

1) On *NIX systems supported by the autoconfiscation tools, do the
   normal

     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install

   to build and install both the dynamic and static libraries.  In
   addition, one may

   - type `make doc' to generate the doxygen documentation; or
   - type `make linebreakdata' to regenerate linebreakdata.c from
     LineBreak.txt.

2) On systems where GCC and Binutils are supported, one can type

     cp -p Makefile.gcc Makefile
     make

   to build the static library.  In addition, one may

   - type `make debug' or `make release' to explicitly generate the
     debug or release build;
   - type `make doc' to generate the doxygen documentation; or
   - type `make linebreakdata' to regenerate linebreakdata.c from
     LineBreak.txt.

3) On Windows, apart from using method 1 (Cygwin/MSYS) and method 2
   (MinGW), MSVC can also be used.  Type

     nmake -f Makefile.msvc

   to build the static library.  By default the debug release is built.
   To build the release version

     nmake -f Makefile.msvc CFG="linebreak - Win32 Release"
